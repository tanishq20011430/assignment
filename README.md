Overview

This project analyzes datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. It combines data from multiple sources to uncover insights into user demographics, session details, and meal preferences. The analysis also provides actionable business recommendations based on the findings.

Objectives

Clean and preprocess datasets from multiple sheets.

Merge the data to create a unified dataset for analysis.

Analyze user orders, session patterns, and demographic influences.

Visualize insights using detailed charts and graphs.

Provide business recommendations based on findings.

Datasets Used

UserDetails - Contains demographic and registration details of users.

CookingSessions - Logs session data such as start/end times, ratings, and meal types.

OrderDetails - Tracks order history, status, and ratings.

Key Insights
