User Behavior and Order Trends Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. It combines data from multiple sources to uncover insights into user demographics, session details, and meal preferences. The analysis also provides actionable business recommendations based on the findings.

Objectives

Clean and preprocess datasets from multiple sheets.

Merge the data to create a unified dataset for analysis.

Analyze user orders, session patterns, and demographic influences.

Visualize insights using detailed charts and graphs.

Provide business recommendations based on findings.

Datasets Used

UserDetails - Contains demographic and registration details of users.

CookingSessions - Logs session data such as start/end times, ratings, and meal types.

OrderDetails - Tracks order history, status, and ratings.

Key Insights

Popular Dishes: Spaghetti and Caesar Salad were the most frequently ordered meals.

Meal Types: Dinner orders dominated, especially in the evenings.

User Demographics: Older users (aged 40+) and those in cities like New York and Los Angeles placed more orders.

Session Trends: Longer cooking sessions correlated with higher session ratings.

Order Ratings: Most orders had high ratings (4-5 stars), while some cancellations highlighted areas for improvement.

Business Recommendations

Target Dinner Promotions: Focus on marketing dinner options and highlight popular dishes.

Engage Older Users: Design special offers for older demographics who show higher ordering activity.

Reduce Cancellations: Offer incentives or discounts to convert canceled orders into completed ones.

Leverage Locations: Prioritize marketing efforts in high-order cities like New York and Los Angeles.
